# Automated testing of a dynamic web application
This repository contains most of the theoretical parts of my master thesis project, which was published at Link√∂ping University in June 2014.

## Abstract
Software testing plays an important role in the process of verifying software functionality and preventing bugs in production code. By writing automated tests using code instead of conducting manual tests, the amount of tedious work during the development process can be reduced and the software quality can be improved.
