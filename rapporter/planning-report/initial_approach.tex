The first step is to begin a literature study, in order to learn more
about testing web applications and the challenges of that area. The Ruby
language and the Rails framework will be studied since that is the
context that the question formulation will be tested in. We will also
look at the Knockout.js framework, which is also used in the exiting
system. Furthermore, literature about automatic test generation will be
read.\\

A test implementation for automatic test generation will be written if
it seems plausible to realize. This will be tried out on tests in the
existing system, and different ways of testing will also be probed by
implementing new functionality into the system and study different
aspects of the written tests.\\

In order to evaluate the results, performance factors such as code
coverage and test execution times will be used. Some subjective measure
of the difficulty of writing new tests will also be evaluated.\\
