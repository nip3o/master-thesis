% In large organizations, there is often a need for efficient
% administration of staff. Resource planning is often used to determine
% the required production capacity in order to reach a specific goal. One
% example could be the required number of examinations that is needed to
% be done at a hospital in order to keep the waiting times within specific
% bounds. The results of the resource planning poses as the base for
% allocating staff. GOLI is a startup company developing a web application
% for production planning, currently focused on following up plans and
% goals. Due to requirements from customers, the code base will be
% extended to include new features.\\

During code refactoring or implementation of new features in software,
errors often occur in existing parts. This may have a serious impact on
the reliability of the system, thus jeopardizing user's confidence for
the system. Automatic testing is utilized to verify the functionality of
software in order to detect bugs and errors before they end up in a
production environment.\\

The goal of this final thesis is to analyze how automatic testing can be
introduced in an existing web application in a good way, and if lower-
level tests can be derived from existing high-level tests automatically.
We will also study how this can be applied when extending the system
with new features.\\

The main research questions of this project are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can a combination of low-level and high-level testing be
          used when testing a web application?
    \item How can tests be implemented when adding new functionality
          into existing software?
    \item Is it possible to automatically derive lower-level unit tests
          from high-level behavioral tests?
\end{itemize}


% The current system uses automatic testing to some extent, primary
% behavior-level testing in the Cucumber framework. According to the
% developers, these tests are cumbersome to write and takes long time to
% run.
