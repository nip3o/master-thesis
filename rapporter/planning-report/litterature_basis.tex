The literature basis will be focused on how automated testing can be used
in a web application in order to achieve good test coverage, make tests
easy to write and run them sufficiently fast.\\

\citet{article:mappingstudy} presents the results of a classification
and analysis of over seventy articles about web application testing. This
will be a good way to get and overview of the area, and to find other
relevant articles on the subject.\\

To get a good and recent view on how testing typically is done in Rails,
the official community guide on testing Rails applications seems like a
good starting-point.\\

\citet{article:test-generation-web} researches ways to automatically
generate tests for web applications. This will be the starting point for
the part of the question formulation that covers automatic test
generation.
