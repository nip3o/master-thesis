All execution times below are mean values of multiple runs and excluding
start-up time. Execution times was measured on a 13" mid-2012 Macbook
Air\footnote{\url{http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-
air/specs /macbook-air-core-i5-1.8-13-mid-2012-specs.html}} with 1.83
GHz Intel Core i5 processor and Mac OS 10.9.2. Google Chrome 34.0.1847
was used as browser for execution of browser tests and Jasmine unit
tests. The browser window was focused in order to mitigate effects of
Mac OS X power saving features.\\

\subsubsection{Before the case study}

The total running time of the 59 RSpec integration- and unit tests
before the case study was 23.0 seconds. Average test execution time was
340 ms per test, which means an execution rate of 3.0 tests per
second.\\

Twelve Cucumber browser tests existed at this time (with 178 steps), but
none of these tests passed at this stage. After fixing the most critical
issues with these tests, 36 steps passed in 42.7 seconds. The average
time per test was 3.6 seconds. These numbers are however not entirely
fair compared to later test runs, since large parts of the tests could
not be run at this stage.\\


\subsubsection{After refactoring old tests}

Several of the previous tests was removed and replaced by more efficient
tests during the second part of the case study. 58 RSpec integration-
and unit tests existed after this stage, an the total execution time was
8.3 seconds.\\

The running time of the ten Cucumber tests (with 118 steps) was 160
seconds, and the average time per test was 18 seconds.\\


\subsubsection{After implementation of new functionality}

In total, 81 RSpec integration- and unit tests existed at this stage,
and the execution time of these was 7.6 seconds. Average test execution
time was 94 ms per test, and the rate was 10.7 tests per
second.\\

At this phase, 34 Jasmine unit tests had been written and the total
running time of these was 0.043 seconds. Average execution time was 1.3
ms per test and the rate was 791 tests per second.\\

The running time of the three RSpec browser tests was 12.4 seconds, with
an average time per test of 4.1 seconds per test. One of the Cucumber
tests had been re-factored into RSpec browser tests, and the running
time of the remaining nine Cucumber browser tests (with 111 steps) was
153 seconds. The average time per test was 17 seconds.\\
