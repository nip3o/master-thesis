Before the case study, Cucumber\footnote{\url{http://cukes.info/}} and
RSpec\footnote{\url{http://rspec.info/}} were used as testing frameworks
for existing tests. Both these frameworks are very popular and actively
maintained. We also considered
Minitest\footnote{\url{https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest}}, but
concluded that it did not have enough interesting advantages over RSpec
compared to the effort of migrating the existing RSpec tests.\\

TimeCop\footnote{\url{https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop}} was
used in order to mock date and time for a test that was dependent on the
current date and time. We do not have much experience from using this
tool, but it worked as we expected for our specific use.\\
