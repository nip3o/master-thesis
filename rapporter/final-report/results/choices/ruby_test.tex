Before the case study, Cucumber\footnote{\url{http://cukes.info/}} and
RSpec\footnote{\url{http://rspec.info/}} were used as testing frameworks
for existing tests. We evaluated these frameworks, as well as considered
new frameworks in the beginning of the case study.\\

TimeCop\footnote{\url{https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop}} was
used in order to mock date and time for a test that was dependent on the
current date and time. We do not have much experience from using this
tool, but it worked as we expected for our specific use.\\
