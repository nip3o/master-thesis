As discussed in \fref{sec:choices}, we were unable to find any working
frameworks for mutation testing our code. We did however do a manual
test, where ten mutants was manually created for a single part of the
code.\\

The tests for the evaluated Ruby controller killed six of the ten
generated mutants (leaving four alive mutants). Three of the alive
mutants mutated the same line in different ways.\\

For the client-side tests, eight out of ten mutants was killed. The two
alive mutants however showed to be equivalent due to the occasionally
erratic behavior of Javascript. For instance, the expressions |0 + 1|
and |null + 1| both evaluates to |1|\footnote{There is a talk by Gary
Bernhardt on this topic which is well worth watching.
