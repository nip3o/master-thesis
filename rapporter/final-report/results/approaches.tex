For the server side, we have chosen to mainly write integration
tests, since the server side in this particular application is mostly
concerned about loading and storing data. Most of these are integration
tests of Rails controllers, which send a request with input data to the
controller and asserts that correct data exist in database. We argue
that it would be hard to write good unit tests for such logic
without using an actual database and requests. Low-level unit tests
without database access have instead been written for model instance
methods, since these tend to have more well defined input and output
data.\\

On the client-side, we have mostly focused on writing isolated unit tests,
since most of all logic and calculations takes place on the
client side in this particular application. A few large system-level
browser tests was written in order to test the integration between the
server- and client-side, as well as some of the integration between
tested client-side units.\\
