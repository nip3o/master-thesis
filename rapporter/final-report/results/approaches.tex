For the server side, we have chosen to mainly write integration-level
tests, since the server side in this particular application is mostly
concerned about loading and storing data. Most of these are integration
tests of Rails controllers, which sends a request with input data to the
controller and asserts that the correct data exists in database. We
argue that it would be hard to write good unit-level tests for such
logic without using an actual database and requests. Low-level unit
tests without database access has instead been written for model
instance methods, since these tends to have more well defined input and
output data.\\

On the client-side, we have mostly focused on writing isolated unit-
tests, since most of all logic and calculations takes place on the
client side in this particular application. A few large system-level
browser tests was written in order to test the integration between the
server- and client side, as well as some of the integration between
tested client- side units.\\
