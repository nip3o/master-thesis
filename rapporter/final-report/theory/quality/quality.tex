There are several metrics for evaluating different quality factors of
written tests. One key property of tests is that they must be able to
detect defects in the code, since that is typically the very main reason
for writing tests at all. We have chosen to call this property
\emph{test efficiency}. Another quality factor is the performance of the
tests, i.e. the execution time of the test suite. This section explains
the properties of these quality factors, as well as their purpose.\\

Readability and ease of writing of tests is another important property
which are not mentioned in this section, since it is hard to measure in
an objective way. It also often depends on the testing framework rather
than on the tests themselves. We evaluate these properties for each
chosen testing framework instead.\\
