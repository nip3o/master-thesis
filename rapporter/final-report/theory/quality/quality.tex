There are several metrics for evaluating different quality factors of
written tests. One key property of tests is that they must be able to
detect defects in the code, since that is typically the very main reason
for writing tests at all. We have chosen to call this property
\emph{test efficiency}. Another quality factor is the performance of the
tests, i.e. the execution time of the test suite. This section explains
the properties of these quality factors, as well as their purpose.\\
