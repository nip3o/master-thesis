Performance of the developed software is often considered to be of great
importance in software development. Some people mean that the
performance of tests are just as important.\\

\citet{video:fast_slow_test} talks about the problem with depending too
much on large tests which are slow to run. He also mentions how the
execution time of a test can increase radically as the code base grows
bigger, even if the test itself is not changed. If the system is small
when the test is written, the test will run pretty fast even if it uses
a large part of the total system. As the system gets bigger, so does the
number of functions invoked by the test, thus increasing the execution
time.\\
