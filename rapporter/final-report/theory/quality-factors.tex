\subsection{Test coverage}

Test coverage\footnote{Also known as \emph{code coverage}} is a measure to
describe to which degree the program source code is tested by a certain
test suite.\cite{wiki:coverage}

However, \citeauthor{book:art_of_testing} shows that a simple
20-statement program consisting of a single loop with a couple of nested
if-statements can have 100 trillion different logical paths. While real-
world programs might not have such extreme amounts of logical paths,
they are typically much larger and more complex. In other words can it
be close to impossible to achieve full path test coverage in many
cases.\\
