\emph{Acceptance testing} is an even higher-level step of testing than
system- level testing. Its purpose is to determine whether or not the
whole system satisfies the criteria agreed upon by the customer. This
process may involve evaluation of the results from existing system tests
as well as doing manual testing and assure that features for certain
use-cases exists. Unlike lower levels of testing, acceptance level
testing not only assures that the system works but also that it contains
the correct features. \cite{book:adp, wiki:acceptance}\\

We consider acceptance testing to be partially outside the scope of this
thesis, but have chosen to include a brief introduction to it for
completeness and understanding of other concepts later on.\\
