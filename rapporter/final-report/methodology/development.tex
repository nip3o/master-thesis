An iterative development methodology is used during the case study and
the implementation of new functionality. We would however not say that
any specific development methodology is used in particular, since we
merely have chosen a few basic ideas and concepts which occurs in agile
development methodologies such as Extreme Programming or Scrum. The
development has been performed in cycles, where we have presented our
results and discussed the further development with the commissioner body
approximately once a week. Test-driven development methodologies has
been used in as strict way as possible, but it is hard to say that we
have followed either the TDD or BDD development methodology strictly as
we have used concepts originating from both these methodologies. We have
also found that the apprehension of TDD and BDD in some blogs and talks
tend to deviate slightly from their original definitions by
\citeauthor{book:tdd_beck} and \citeauthor{web:dan_north}, which makes
the line between these even more diffuse.\\
