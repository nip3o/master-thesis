An iterative development methodology is used during the case study and
the implementation of new functionality. We would however not say that
any specific development methodology is used in particular, since we
merely have chosen a few basic ideas and concepts which occur in agile
development methodologies such as Extreme Programming or Scrum.\\

The development is performed in cycles, where the results and the future
development are presented and discussed with the commissioning body
approximately once a week. Test-driven development methodologies is used
in the strictest way possible. However, neither the TDD nor the BDD
development methodology is followed strictly, as concepts originating
from both these methodologies are used.\\

The apprehension of TDD and BDD in some blogs and talks tend to deviate
slightly from their original definitions by \citeauthor{book:tdd_beck}
and \citeauthor{web:dan_north}. During the development process of this
thesis, the original definitions of these methodologies are used.\\
