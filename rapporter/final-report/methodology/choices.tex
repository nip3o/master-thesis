Selection of the technologies to use in a certain project is one of the
most important steps, since it affects the rest of the development
process. In this case, the commissioning body of this thesis mainly gave
the choice of frameworks for development since the existing software
used certain programming languages and frameworks. The main server-side
was written in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails framework, and the client-
side code was written in CoffeeScript\footnote{CoffeeScript is a
scripting language that compiles into Javascript.} using the
Knockout.js framework.\\

For the choice of testing-related frameworks, we chose to look for
frequently used and active developed open source frameworks.
Technologies that are used by many people intuitively often have more
resources on how they are used, and also have the advantage of being
more likely to be recognized by future developers.\\

Active development is another crucial property of used frameworks.
Unless a framework is updated continuously, it is likely to soon be
incompatible with future versions of other frameworks, such as Rails.
Another benefit is that new features and bug fixes are released.\\

The Ruby Toolbox website\footnote{\url{https://www .ruby-toolbox.com/}},
which uses information from the Github and RubyGems websites, was
consulted in order to find frameworks with mentioned qualities.\\
