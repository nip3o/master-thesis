\section{Introduction}
The methodology of this thesis is generally based on the guidelines
proposed by \citet{article:casestudies} for conducting a case study.
An objective is defined and a literature study is conducted in
order to establish a theoretical base. The theory is then evaluated by
applying it in a real-life application context, and the result is
analyzed in order to draw conclusions about the theory.
