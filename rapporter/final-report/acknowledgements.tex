This final thesis was conducted at GOLI AB, on the business incubator
LEAD during the spring of 2014. I would like to thank my dear colleagues
Lina, Malin and Madeleine, as well as all other people at LEAD for good
fellowship and encouragement during this period. I specially want to
thank my technical supervisor Mattias for help, support, interesting
discussions and ideas.\\

I would also like to give thanks to my supervisor Anders Fr√∂berg for
help with finding and narrowing down the problem formulation, and my
examiner Erik Berglund for overall help support as well as feedback on
the final report.\\
