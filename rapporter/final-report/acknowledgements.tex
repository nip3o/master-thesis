This final thesis was conducted at GOLI AB, on the business incubator
LEAD during the spring of 2014. I would like to thank my dear colleagues
Lina Boozon Ekberg, Malin Nylander and Madeleine Nylander, as well as
all other people at LEAD for good fellowship and encouragement during
this period. I specially want to thank my technical supervisor Mattias
Ekberg for help, support, interesting discussions and ideas.\\

I would also like to give thanks to my supervisor Anders Fröberg as well
as my examiner Erik Berglund for overall help and support. Additionally,
I would like to thank Sophia Björsner for linguistic feedback and help
with improving my language.\\

Last but not least, I would like to thank my opponent Filip Källström as
well as my friend Fredrik Palm for proof reading and helpful suggestions
and discussions during the whole working process.\\
