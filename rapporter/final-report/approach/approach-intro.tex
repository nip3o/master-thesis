Based on the theory discussed in \ref{chap:theory}, this chapter
outlines a hypothesis about how testing of the ECP system should be
implemented. We also constitute activities that should be done during
the case study, and thus forms the base for the results presented in
\ref{chap:results}. In \ref{chap:discussion}, we compare the outlined
hypothesis described in this chapter to the actual results in order to
see how well this hypothesis worked in practice.
