The case study will be divided into three sub parts. The purpose of each
sub part is to evaluate some aspects of the testing approach, in order
to give a good evaluation of the chosen testing approach when
combined.\\


\subsection{Refactoring of old tests}

There have been attempts to introduce testing of the ECP system a while
back, but this attempts stopped since the chosen approaches was found to
be very cumbersome. At the start of this project, the implemented tests
had not been maintained for a very long time, which resulted in that
many tests failed although the system itself worked fine.\\

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:hypothesis}, TDD methodology will be
used during the case study. This methodology is based on the fact that
tests are written before implementation of new features and then run
iteratively during development. The test suite should pass, then fail
after a new test has been implemented, and then pass again after the new
feature has been implemented. This of course presupposes that existing
tests can be run and give predictable results.\\

The first part of the case study is therefore to make all old tests run.
Apart from being a prerequisite for new tests and features to be
implemented, it also gives a view on how tests are affected as new
functionality is implemented. This is especially interesting since it
would be impossible to evaluate such factors in the scope of a master
thesis otherwise. It will also give a perspective on some of the
advantages and drawbacks of the old testing approach.\\

Another drawback of the old tests are the fact that their running time
are too high to run them continuously, in a TDD manner. Another
objective of this part of the case study is therefore to make them
faster, so at least some of the tests can be run continuously.\\


\subsection{Implementation of new functionality}

A new feature will be implemented.
