The case study is divided into three sub parts. The purpose of each sub
part is to evaluate some aspects of the testing approach. When combined,
the different parts give a good overview on the chosen testing approach
as a whole.\\


\subsection{Refactoring of old tests}
\label{sec:casestudy_1}

There have been previous attempts to introduce testing of the
application. Developers did however stop writing tests since the chosen
approaches were found to be very cumbersome. At the start of this
thesis, the implemented tests had not been maintained for a very long
time, which resulted in that many tests failed although the system
itself worked fine.\\

The TDD methodology is used during the case study. This methodology is
based on the principle of writing tests before implementation of new
features, and then run the tests iteratively during development. The
test suite should pass at first. Then a new test should be implemented
and the test suite should fail. The test suite should then pass again
after the new feature has been implemented. This of course presupposes
that existing tests can be run and give predictable results.\\

Due to this presumption, the first step of the case study is to make all
old tests run. Apart from being a condition for new tests and features
to be implemented, it also gives a view on how tests are affected as new
functionality is implemented. This is especially interesting since it
otherwise would be impossible to evaluate such factors in the scope of a
master's thesis. It also gives a perspective on some of the advantages
and drawbacks of the old testing approach.\\

Another drawback of the old tests is the fact that they run too slow in
order to be continuously in a test-driven manner. Another objective of
this part of the case study is therefore to make them faster, so at
least some of the tests can be run continuously.\\


\subsection{Implementation of new functionality}
\label{sec:casestudy_2}

As previously mentioned, the commissioning body of this project wishes to
implement support for planning resources in the GOLI application. During
this part of the case study, the functionality is implemented and tests
are written for new parts of the system as well as for refactored
code.\\

The purpose of this part of the case study is, besides implementing the
new feature itself, to evaluate test-driven development and how tests
and implementation code can be written together by using TDD methodology
and an iterative development process. We also gain more experience of
writing unit tests in order to evaluate how different kinds of tests
serves different purposes in the development process.\\


\subsection{Analyzing quality metrics}
\label{sec:casestudy_3}

In order to evaluate the tests written in previous parts of the case
study, test coverage is used as a measure. The last part of the case
study focuses on analyzing quality metrics of the GOLI application in
general as well as for newly implemented functionality. We evaluate the
tests written in previous parts of the case study and complement them if
needed. The purpose of this part is to get experience of using test
coverage as a measure for test quality, and to produce a measurable
output of the case study.\\
