\begin{itemize}
    \item A test-driven development methodology is used during
          development, and tests are written before implementation.
    \item The major parts of all written tests are low-level unit tests.
    \item A few system level tests are written in order to test the
          integration of all units together.
    \item System level tests are run with Selenium in order for them
          to detect cross-browser system bugs.
    \item Test coverage should be used for measuring test quality.
