\begin{itemize}
    \item A combination of behavioral-driven and test-driven development
          is used during development. Tests are written before
          implementation and is described using sentences.
    \item Tests are written in code using RSpec rather than using an
          ubiquitous language as used by Cucumber.
    \item The major part of all written tests are low-level unit tests.
    \item A few of system level tests are written in order to test the
          integration of all units together.
    \item System level tests are run with Selenium in order for them
          to detect cross-browser system bugs.
    \item Test coverage is analyzed continuously and full branch
          coverage should be striven for.
