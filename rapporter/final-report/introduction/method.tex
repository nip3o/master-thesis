The methodology for this thesis is based on the characteristics and
guidelines proposed by \citet{article:casestudies}. An objective is
defined, and a literature study is conducted in order to establish a
theoretical base. The theory is evaluated by applying it in a real-life
application context, and the result is analyzed in order to draw
conclusions about the theory.


\subsection{Literature study}

The literature study is focused on web application testing overall, and
on how tests can be generated automatically.
\citet{article:mappingstudy} presents the results of a mapping study on
the subject of web application testing, and is a good starting point for
getting to know different testing aspects and contains relevant articles
on the subject for further reading.
