The goal of this final thesis is to analyze how automated tests can be
introduced in an existing web application, in order to detect software
bugs and errors before they end up in a production environment. In order
to do this, a case study is conducted focused on how this can be done in
the GOLI production planning system. We use the results from this case
study in order to discuss how testing can be applied to dynamic web
applications in general.\\

The main research question is thus to determine how testing can be
introduced in the scope of the GOLI ECP application, and how tests
can be applied when implementing new functionality. We focus on
techniques which are relevant this specific application, i.e.
techniques relevant to web applications that uses Ruby on Rails
\footnote{Ruby on Rails framework, \url{http://rubyonrails.org/}}
and KnockoutJS
\footnote{KnockoutJS framework, \url{http://knockoutjs.com/}} with a
MongoDB\footnote{MongoDB document database, \url{https://www.mongodb.org/}}
database system for data storage. We investigate which kind of
problems that are specific to this kind of environment, and how these
kinds of problems can be solved.\\
