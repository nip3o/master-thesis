The goal of this final thesis is to analyze how automatic testing can be
introduced in an existing web application in a good way, and if lower-
level tests can be derived from existing high-level tests automatically.
We will also study how this can be applied when extending the system
with new features.\\

The main research questions of this project are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can a combination of low-level and high-level testing be
          used when testing a web application?
    \item How can tests be implemented when adding new functionality
          into existing software?
    \item Is it possible to automatically derive lower-level unit tests
          from high-level behavioral tests?
\end{itemize}
