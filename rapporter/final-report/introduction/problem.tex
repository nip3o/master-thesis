The goal of this final thesis is to analyze how automated tests can be
introduced in an existing web application, in order to detect software
bugs and errors before they end up in a production environment. In order
to do this, a case study is conducted focused on how this can be done in
the GOLI production planning system. We use the results from this case
study in order to discuss how testing can be applied to dynamic web
applications in general.\\

The main research question is to determine how testing can be introduced
in the scope of the application (GOLI Kapacitetsplanering). Which tools
and frameworks are available, and how well do they work in the given
environment? How can test-driven development methodologies be used and
how can we evaluate the quality of the written tests? We focus on
techniques which are relevant this specific application, i.e. techniques
relevant to web applications that uses Ruby on Rails
\footnote{\url{http://rubyonrails.org/}} and KnockoutJS
\footnote{\url{http://knockoutjs.com/}} with a
MongoDB\footnote{\url{https://www.mongodb.org/}} database system for
data storage.\\
