There exists different categories of software testing, for example
performance testing and security testing. The scope of this thesis is
tests in which the purpose is to verify the functionality of a part of
the system rather than measuring its characteristics. We will also only
cover automatic testing, as opposed to manual testing where the
execution and result evaluation of the test is done by a human. The term
\emph{testing} will hereby refer to automatic software testing unless
specified otherwise.\\

Since the result of this thesis will be evaluated in specific web
application (i.e. GOLI Kapacitetsplanering), we will only cover
techniques which are relevant this specific application. In other words,
we will focus on testing web applications which uses Ruby on
Rails\footnote{Ruby on Rails framework, \url{http://rubyonrails.org/}}
and KnockoutJS\footnote{KnockoutJS framework,
\url{http://knockoutjs.com/}}. We will not cover testing static views
or any issues related to the deployment of a dynamic web application,
but rather testing of the dynamic application itself.\\
