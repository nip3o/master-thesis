There exist several different categories of software testing, for
example performance testing and security testing. The scope of this
thesis is tests in which the purpose is to verify the functionality of a
part of the system rather than measuring its characteristics. This
thesis also only cover automatic testing, as opposed to manual testing
where a human does the execution and result evaluation of the test.
Testing static views or any issues related to the deployment of a
dynamic web application is not covered by this thesis either.
