There exists different categories of software testing, for example
performance testing and security testing. The scope of this thesis is
tests in which the purpose is to verify the functionality of a part of
the system rather than measuring its characteristics. We will also only
cover automatic testing, as opposed to manual testing where the
execution and result evaluation of the test is done by a human. The term
\emph{testing} will hereby refer to automatic software testing unless
specified otherwise.\\

We will also not cover testing static views or any issues related to the
deployment of a dynamic web application, but rather testing of the
dynamic application itself.
