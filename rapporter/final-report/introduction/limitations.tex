There exists different categories of software testing, for example
performance testing and security testing. The scope of this thesis is
quality assurance testing, in which the purpose is to verify the
functionality of a part of the system rather than measuring its
characteristics. We will also only cover automatic testing, as opposed
to manual testing where the execution and result evaluation of the test
is done by a human. The term testing will hereby refer to automatic
software quality assurance testing unless specified otherwise.\\

Since the result of this thesis will be evaluated in specific web
application (i.e. the GOLI production planning application), we will
only cover techniques which are relevant this specific application. In
other words, we will focus on testing web applications which uses Ruby
on Rails and the Knockout.js framework.\\
