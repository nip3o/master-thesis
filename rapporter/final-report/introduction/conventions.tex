The intended audience of this report is primarily people with some or
good knowledge of programming and software development. A great deal of
knowledge in the area of software testing or test methodologies should
however not be required. The report can probably be of interest for
people without programming knowledge which is interested in the area of
software testing and development.\\

Code examples are written in Ruby\footnote{\url{https://www.ruby-
lang.org}} since that is the primary language of this thesis, but with
emphasis on being understandable by people without knowledge of this
language rather than using Ruby-specific tools and practices.\\

The area of software development contains several terminologies which
are similar or exactly the same. In cases where multiple different
terminologies exists for a certain concept, we have chosen the term with
most hits on Google. The purpose of this was to choose the most widely-
used term, and the number of search results seemed like a good measure
for this. Footnotes with alternative terminologies is present where
applicable.\\
